      Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics.[14] He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering.[15][14] According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.[16]

During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[9] Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.[17][18] Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue doing it forever.[19] He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[20] In 2006, he dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and performance.[21][22] He moved to Mumbai, took up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.[23] Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute in which he remained for two and a half years.[24][25]

He was spotted by a casting team of Balaji Telefilms while he was working at the Prithvi Theatre.[17] Rajput was subsequently called for an audition and cast as a second lead in the television series Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil in 2008.[26][27] He had secured the role of Preet Singh Juneja, the stepbrother of the lead named Harshad Chopda and entered the show in its seventh episode.[28] The character was killed early in the show, but due to popularity among viewers was brought back in the series finale as a spirit looking on as his family celebrated coming out of difficult times.[29] The performance had made an impression on the producer Ekta Kapoor who vouched for him to be cast as the lead in another series Pavitra Rishta,[26] reportedly against the wishes of the hosting channel, Zee TV.[30][31]

In Pavitra Rishta, Rajput was cast as Manav Deshmukh who was an "ideal son and husband" and co-starred along with Ankita Lokhande.[32] The role was reportedly a breakthrough for him and for which he won various television awards,[33] including his first award for best actor in the Indian Television Academy Awards 2010.[34] He also won three major television awards in the categories of best male actor and most popular actor.[35] In 2010, he joined the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha in its second season as part of the Mast Kalandar Boys team.[36][35] On the Mother's Day special episode, the team dedicated a performance to Rajput's mother who had died.[37] Later in the same year, he also took part in the fourth season of another dance competition reality show called Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and was paired alongside the choreographer Shampa Sonthalia; they emerged as the runners-up of the season.[36]

Rajput continued to act in Pavitra Rishta from its first airing in 2009 till his exit in 2011,[38] having played the part of the protagonist of the series for two and a half years at the time of his exit.[39] He had stated that he intended to move to the United States to study filmmaking and had already gained experience behind the scenes in the film Raaz 2,[27] where he was an assistant director.[40] Rajput made a later reappearance in the final episode of Pavitra Rishta in 2014 after gaining critical acclaim in Bollywood.[39]

In 2011, Rajput was spotted by Mukesh Chhabra, the casting director of Kai Po Che!, who invited him for an audition.[41][42] He was in the process of enrolling for a course in filmmaking at Stanford University but decided to accept the offer.[17] He was subsequently cast in the role of Ishaan Bhatt, a district-level cricketer who was a victim of politics in the selection fraternity and one of the three leads, along with Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh.[43][44] The film was directed by Abhishek Kapoor and based on the Chetan Bhagat novel called The 3 Mistakes of My Life, which dealt with the life of three friends affected by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2002 Gujarat riots. It was released in 2013 and became a critical and commercial success.[45] Rajput received a nomination for the Filmfare Awards in the category of best debut actor for his performance in the film.[46][47]

Before the release of his debut film Kai Po Che!, Rajput was signed in by Rajkumar Hirani for a role in the Aamir Khan-starrer satirical drama called PK.[17][48] In the film, he was cast as the boyfriend to Anushka Sharma's character of a journalist.[49] He also entered into a deal with Yash Raj Films beginning with the starring role in the film Shuddh Desi Romance.[17] The film was a romantic comedy, where Rajput played the character of Raghu Ram Sitaram, a tour guide who fell in love with a woman on the way to his own marriage, it featured Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor.[18][50] Shuddh Desi Romance was released in 2013 and became a sleeper hit.[51] Following the release of his first two films, Rajput was described by the veteran director Shekhar Kapur as "one of the most inspiring young actors to emerge out of India" and was occasionally referred to as the "next SRK".[17] The film PK was later released in 2014 and became the highest grossing Indian film.[52][53]

In June 2013, Yash Raj Films and Dibakar Banerjee Productions announced the joint production of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! with Sushant Singh Rajput in the starring role.[54][55] Rajput began working on the new project following the release of his second film Shuddh Desi Romance.[56] The film was a mystery action-thriller featuring Byomkesh Bakshi, a fictional detective originally created by the Bengali writer Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay.[57] Dibakar Banerjee, the director of the film and the IP rights holder of Byomkesh Bakshi stories had signed him in to play the part of the protagonist.[17] Before the release, Rajput made a special appearance in the police crime drama CID in the character of Byomkesh Bakshy.[58] The film was released on 3 April 2015,[59] and failed to perform well in the box office, but received positive critical reviews.[60][61] In September 2013, Rajput began collaborating with Shekhar Kapur for his upcoming project Paani, a film set in the future that showcased a world where wars where being fought over water.[62] The film was initially reported to be starred by Hrithik Roshan and then Vivek Oberoi but finally went to Rajput after Yash Raj Films entered in its co-production and opted for his inclusion.[63] He had reportedly attended workshops with Kapur for 10 months before the project was suspended in 2015 when the Yash Raj Films backed out of it.[64][65] In the aftermath, Rajput ended his contract with the producti

<br><i>Death
    Main article: Death of Sushant Singh Rajput
    On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan[1] in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[184] He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from bipolar disorder.[185][186][187] The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.[188] The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"[189] and called it a "clear case of suicide."[190] The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time).[191] No foul play was found.[192] The viscera report likewise ruled out foul play.[193] On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.[194]
    
    On 31 July, Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case to investigate the money laundering of Rajput's money from his bank accounts by Chakraborty, her parents and associates.[195] On 19 August 2020, the Supreme Court of India allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian national government's top investigating agency, to take control of the investigation[196] and ordered the CBI to look into any future cases registered in relation to Rajput's death.[197] Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also filed a case to investigate drug peddling, based on phone chats forwarded to it by ED during its investigation.[198]
    
    On 8 September, Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the NCB in a drug case linked to the investigation of the death probe. Prior to the arrest, 9 others were arrested by the NCB in the drug case including Rhea's brother, Showik Chakraborty.[199] On 12 July 2022, the NCB filed draft charges against 35 people, including Rhea Chakraborty and her brother. The NCB claimed that Rajput had been using numerous people to obtain drugs since 2018 and accused his flatmate Pithani and others of “aiding and abetting” Rajput to “extreme drug addiction.”[200]
    
    On 7 September, Chakraborty filed an FIR against the late actor's sisters, claiming they had supplied him psychotrophic anti-depressants[201] without proper medical consultation and using a forged prescription.[202] She requested an investigation into whether these had resulted in his suicide or a decline in his mental state.[203] The following month, Rajput's sisters asked the High Court to cancel the FIR.[201] The Bombay High Court agreed to invalidate the FIR against his sister Meetu but upheld the FIR against his sister Priyanka, stating that there was "prima facie evidence" against her.[202] The Supreme Court also rejected an appeal filed by Priyanka Singh and the filing was handed to the CBI to investigate.[202]
    
    On 3 October, Dr. Sudhir Gupta of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, leader of a forensic medical team tasked by CBI for assistance, said, "Sushant death is a case of suicide. Murder completely ruled out."[204] Gupta told Asian News International (ANI), "There were no injuries over the body other than hanging. There were no marks of struggle or scuffle in the body and clothes of the deceased."[205] On 5 October, ANI reported that the AIIMS medical board had submitted its report to CBI confirming that Rajput died by suicide and ruling out murder.[206] On 15 October 2020, the CBI said it "continues to investigate the death of Rajput. There are certain speculative reports in the media that the CBI has reached a conclusion. It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous."[207]</i>
